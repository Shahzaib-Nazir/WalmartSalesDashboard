<h1>Walmart Sales Dashboard</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project uses a kaggle dataset of Walmart sales giving insights to the relation of sales with correspondence to factors such as unemployment rate, fuel prices, temperature and more using Power BI visualizations. First by cleaning the data to remove missing data or wrong entry data in columns, the data was transformed to add month and year columns for filtering the dashboard by a year or month. The data was used to make visualizations with Dark and blue colored theme and multiple KPI's to convey relevant numerical information. The dashboard has been made easy to understand for any type of user to filter it according to thier needs and grasp the trends whether they may be the CEO or a manager for specific stores.
